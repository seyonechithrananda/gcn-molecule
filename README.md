# Graph Convolutional Networks for Learning Molecular Fingerprints 
Compilation of models for grapb representation learning on molecular graphs for property prediction, QSAR modelling, and more.

You can also check out the fork of the Graph Convolutional Policy Network [a link], a generative model for SMILES strings.  (https://github.com/seyonechithrananda/rl_graph_generation/tree/test)

The GraphConv QSAR model functions as a model for modelling quantity structure-activity relationships + predicting solubilities in the RDKit Solublity dataset. Data: (https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/blob/master/Docs/Book/data/solubility.train.sdf)

The GCN tox21 network learns on the Tox21 multitask dataset, and shows how to build a custom GraphConv model from scratch using the DeepChem library.

# Note:
GCN_non_policy does not work right now, as I deal with some issues using DeepChem.
